# How to create a user account

***Account creation is moderated by the wiki administrators - once you request an account, and confirm your email address, it will be created for you as quickly as possible. We are protecting this wiki from spambots and bad actors.***

If you would like to make changes to wiki pages, do this:

1.  Follow the [Log in](Special:UserLogin) link at the top of any page;
2.  Click on [request a new account](Special:RequestAccount).
    -   (You may also click on the above link to go directly there.)

There may be some delay in creating your account - if you would like to hurry us up a little, ask for help [ on the oVirt IRC channel](Communication#IRC) or [ on the Users mailing list](Communication#Mailing_lists)

Once you have your user account, read <Help:Editing> and the related content in the [:Category:Documentation for writing on the wiki](:Category:Documentation for writing on the wiki).

## Deprecated method

If you are a wiki contributor already and want to add a new contributor directly, you can follow [these directions](http://wiki.ovirt.org/w/index.php?title=How_to_create_a_user_account&oldid=3998).
