# Project wiki template

*This is a template for using a category as the primary wiki page for an oVirt project.*

*Read more about [How to make pages](How to make pages) for information on page creation.*

Introduction goes here ... before you put in any sub-sections.

Make the introduction just a few short paragraphs.

Remember that all sub-pages and sub-categories will appear **below** the content here. There is no need to index every page, but you may want to directly link to some of them.

__TOC__

## Important Foobar wiki pages

*   In this list, put links to important pages.
*   You may want to link to sub-categories instead, such as [:Category:Foobar QA](:Category:Foobar QA) - note this category URL is constructed with a leading ':' to make it a link to a category instead of putting the source page *in* to the category.

## How to use the wiki for the Foobar project

If you have any specific ways your project uses the wiki, put them here.

## More project information

Use this location to put information that is not on the <http://www.ovirt.org/project/subprojects/> page.

Since the main website is harder to edit, project members may find it easier to write and update supplementary content here.
