# Editing

The oVirt project wiki has a very low barrier to entry for editors. However, there can be a small learning curve when beginning to use wiki, and we have a number of guidelines that all editors should follow. This page provides those guidelines and a few tips to help you get going.

This document is divided in three parts: gaining edit access, basic wiki editing, and more advanced editing.

## Gaining Edit Access

## Etiquette guidelines

Refer to [Help:Wiki rules and etiquette](Help:Wiki rules and etiquette) for some general etiquette guidelines on editing the oVirt wiki.

## Creating pages

To have a wiki that is scalable, there is a need to maintain a proper hierarchy and organization. The best way to learn about these is to review [Help:Wiki structure](Help:Wiki structure) and <Help:Categories>, and then to review the existing layout of the wiki. Our guidelines will help you name your pages in a way that help them be more readable, translatable, and easier for search engines to find and promote.

## Editing with Mediawiki

Refer to [Help:Wiki syntax and markup](Help:Wiki syntax and markup) for basic information on how to write in MediaWiki syntax. It's really easy, and the wiki makes it easy for you to create a beautiful page with almost no markup at all.

## Getting Help

If ever you have questions about editing the oVirt project wiki, or if you need help, please feel free to contact wiki team: via IRC channel (#ovirt on OFTC) or mailing list ([arch@ovirt.org](http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/arch)).
