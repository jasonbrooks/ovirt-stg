## New oVirt website goes live

To better address the needs of our users and community members, the oVirt website has had a visual refresh! There is a new, simpler [download](download) page, a much improved [documentation](documentation) page, and new pages focused on contributors to the [community](community) and [developers](develop).

There are lots of other goodies to discover, including the ability to embed YouTube videos (as you can see in the [documentation](documentation) page), and the entire site being powered by MediaWiki, with a very nice theme based on the [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework.
